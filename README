## How to Run

1. Build the executables:
    ```
    make
    ```
    This will build the executables in the `build` directory.

2. Start the services:
    ```
    ./start_services.sh
    ```
    This starts the controller and compute nodes execution.

3. Run the client interface:
    ```
    ./build/client
    ```
4. To stop the controller and compute nodes after running the client interface, execute:
    ```
    ./stop_services.sh
    ```

## Cleaning Up

To clean the build, run:
```
make clean
```
